# Analysis of Matrix Power Computation Methods for PRNG State Transition Analysis

This project implements and compares two distinct approaches for computing matrix powers in the context of analyzing state transitions in Pseudo-Random Number Generators (PRNGs). The analysis focuses on efficiently computing the number of valid state transition paths in a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) representation of PRNG states.

## Methods Overview

1. **Direct Matrix Exponentiation**
   - Traditional approach using repeated matrix multiplication
   - Computes the full matrix power A^L
   - Extracts the specific element [0,-1] representing valid transition paths
   - Simple to implement but computationally expensive for large L

2. **Polynomial-based Modular Exponentiation**
   - Advanced approach using Cayley-Hamilton theorem
   - Computes only the required element using polynomial arithmetic
   - Leverages characteristic polynomial for efficient computation
   - Significantly reduces computational complexity for large matrices

## Complexity Analysis

### Matrix Power Method (batch_calculate_total_sum_with_log.py)
- `gen_pairs(m)`: O(m²) - generates all possible pairs for m×m matrix
- `dfa_transition_matrix(m, S)`: O(m²) - creates m×m matrix
- `calculate_single_cached`: O(m³ * log(L)) - matrix multiplication for A^L using repeated squaring
  - For m < 10, matrix size is at most 10×10
  - For L = 2²¹, log(L) = 21
- **Overall Complexity**: O(B(2m) * m³ * log(L))
  - For m < 10, B(2m) ≈ 1.38 × 10¹²
  - Total: O(1.38 × 10¹² * 1000 * 21) = O(2.9 × 10¹⁶)

### Polynomial Method (batch_calculate_total_sum_with_log_poly.py)
- `gen_pairs(m)`: O(m²) - generates all possible pairs for m×m matrix
- `dfa_transition_matrix(m, S)`: O(m²) - creates m×m matrix
- `matrix_modular_exponentiation`: O(m² * log(L)) - uses characteristic polynomial and modular reduction
  - Characteristic polynomial computation: O(m³) = O(1000)
  - Polynomial modular reduction: O(m² * log(L)) = O(100 * 21)
  - Final matrix powers: O(m³) = O(1000)
- **Overall Complexity**: O(B(2m) * m² * log(L))
  - For m < 10, B(2m) ≈ 1.38 × 10¹²
  - Total: O(1.38 × 10¹² * 100 * 21) = O(2.9 × 10¹⁵)

### Performance Analysis
While both methods have similar asymptotic complexity, the polynomial method performs significantly better in practice:

1. **Reduced Matrix Operations**: The polynomial method performs fewer full matrix multiplications
2. **Efficient Modular Reduction**: Uses polynomial arithmetic instead of repeated matrix multiplication
3. **Memory Efficiency**: Requires less memory for intermediate results (O(m) vs O(m²))
4. **Parallelization**: Better suited for parallel processing due to smaller memory footprint

The empirical results show the polynomial method's advantages:
- For m=1: 1.17s vs 1.46s (19.86% faster)
- For m=2: 2.88s vs 5.37s (46.37% faster)
- For m=3: 19.6s vs 76.63s (74.42% faster)
- For m=4: 310.42s vs 2584.17s (87.98% faster)

The speedup increases significantly with larger m values, demonstrating better scaling despite having similar asymptotic complexity.

### Memory Requirements
- Matrix Power Method: O(m² * log(L)) = O(100 * 21) = O(2,100) per process
- Polynomial Method: O(m * log(L)) = O(10 * 21) = O(210) per process

### Numerical Stability
- Both methods use arbitrary-precision arithmetic
- Polynomial method maintains better numerical stability through modular reduction
- Critical for handling large numbers with L = 2²¹

### Potential Optimizations
1. **Pair Generation**: Both methods could benefit from the optimized `gen_pairs` implementation
2. **Matrix Operations**: Specialized algorithms for sparse matrices and modular arithmetic
3. **Parallel Processing**: Further parallelization of matrix and polynomial operations
4. **Memory Management**: Efficient handling of large numbers through modular arithmetic
